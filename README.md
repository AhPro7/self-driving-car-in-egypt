# Self driving car in Egypt
try to build self driving car in Egypt 
# First step is 
## Where am I ?
### Get Data
The main goal of this step is to make the car know where it is. Although the main goal is Egypt, we will compare the three capitals of the world, namely **Cairo**, **Moscow** and **Paris**
The data is from three videos from YouTube, and the selection of the **Cairo** video was not successful, because all the video was at night, so this is a fatal error, I will modify it later
</br></br>
The data is three videos, each video of which was filmed by a motorist in three capitals of different worlds, and they are as follows
1. [Cairo](https://youtu.be/86pZTI5gJQM) 
2. [Moscow](https://youtu.be/YORkrd05BtA)
3. [Paris](https://youtu.be/FBjjYw-xcdg?t=2)
